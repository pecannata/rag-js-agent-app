Context Keywords: Employee
User Message: How many employees did you find? And find the manager of each employee and tell me the department name of the manager and the location of the manager including the location's state (in a separate column) and the current population of the state (in a separate column) and the surrounding states. Even if values are null, please put each employee, manager, department, state, population, and a list of surrounding states in one table at the end of your analysis.
🎯 Domain Analysis Result: {
  shouldExecute: true,
  reasoning: "The user message is clearly discussing employees, managers of those employees, and the departments and locations associated with these roles. The context keyword 'Employee' directly aligns with the query about finding employee details and related information such as manager data, department names, and location specifics.",
