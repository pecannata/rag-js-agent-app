## 📱 User Interface Overview

### **Main Blog Manager**
```
📝 Blog Manager - Enhanced Blog Post Title 🌿 feature/new-content (feature)
[🌿 Versions (3)] [📄 Print]

Current post shows active branch indicator and version count
```

### **Branch Manager Modal**
```
🌿 Blog Post Versions
Manage branches and version history for Post #123

🌿 Branches (3) | 📋 History (12)

[Source Branch] → [Target Branch] [👀 Compare] [🔀 Merge]

🎯 main (main) ✅ Merged
🚀 feature/new-content (feature) 
🔥 hotfix/typo-fix (hotfix) 🗑️ Deleted
```

### **Diff Viewer**
```
Comparing feature/new-content → main

Change Analysis:
■■■■■■■■░░ 80% Impact Score

Side by Side View:
Original (feature/new-content) | Modified (main)
Content line 1                | Content line 1 (updated)
Content line 2                | Content line 2
```

### **Conflict Resolution**
```
🔀 Resolve Merge Conflicts
Merging feature/new-content → main • 2 conflict(s) found

title ⚠️ | content ⚠️

Resolution Options:
🔵 Keep Original (feature/new-content)
🟢 Accept New (main) 
🔀 Merge Both
🧠 AI Suggestion
✏️ Custom Resolution

Preview: [Shows final result]
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **API Architecture**
```typescript
// Branch operations
GET    /api/blog/branches?postId=123
POST   /api/blog/branches
PUT    /api/blog/branches
DELETE /api/blog/branches?postId=123&branchId=abc

// Advanced operations
POST   /api/blog/branches/merge
GET    /api/blog/branches/diff?postId=123&fromBranch=abc&toBranch=def
GET    /api/blog/branches/history?postId=123&branchId=abc
```

### **Caching Strategy**
- **Branch Lists**: 5 minutes TTL
- **Branch Content**: 10 minutes TTL  
- **Diff Results**: 2 minutes TTL
- **Merge History**: 15 minutes TTL
- **Smart Invalidation**: Automatic cache clearing on updates

### **State Management**
```typescript
// Branch-aware state tracking
const {
  setBranchList,
  getBranchContent, 
  setDiffResult,
  invalidatePost
} = useBranchCache();

// Automatic branch detection and switching
const handleBranchSwitch = (branch) => {
  // Unsaved changes protection
  // Content synchronization
  // UI state updates
};
```
